1. Can I run shaders with Distant Horizons?

Yes but only complementary and BSL will work fully with distant horizons in my testing. The rest of the shaders lock your render distance to vanilla values.

2. What are the main features?

This modpack splits its focus between a few themes like magic, fun, cute animals/pets, and tech with other notable elements like looting and dungeons but mainly exploration and enjoying the journey. Notable mods are: 

- Hexerei 

- Ad Astra 

- Immersive Engineering

- Refined Storage

- Tectonic

- Totemic

- Botania

- Twilight Forest

- Farmers Delight

- Create

Additionally there are many bug fixes/optimizations and QOL Improvements which are far too specific/numerous to list (if i were to estimate, I believe QOL and bug fixes make up approximately 20-30% of the mods if not more)

3. Whats the deal with data packs?

  - Curse forge has not implemented automatic data pack loading for 1.20.1. To work around this I have installed Global Packs which should allow for easier data pack injection.

4. How do I report a bug?

   - I have a discord channel for this! Feel free to join to hangout, learn about the pack, or really anything! I would love to learn more about what brought you to my pack as well as what you would like to see or what I could be doing better! There is a suggestions channel as well for this reason.
