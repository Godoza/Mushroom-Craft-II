1. Can I run shaders with Distant Horizons?

Yes but only complementary and BSL will work fully with distant horizons in my testing. The rest of the shaders lock your render distance to vanilla values.

3. What are the main features?

This modpack primarily focuses on fun adventuring, some looting, crafting, and mainly exploration and enjoying the journey. Notable mods are Hexerei, Ad Astra, Immersive Engineering, Refined Storage, and various biome/terrain gen mods like Tectonic, Biomes O' Plenty, and Oh The Biomes You'll Go.

5. Whats the deal with data packs?

Curse forge does has not implemented automatic data pack loading for 1.20.1 yet, so you'll need to move them into your world file in the data pack folder yourself.
