This modpack is primarily designed to be fun. It has aspects that overlap genres such as exploration, combat, comfy asethetics, and cute creatures. 


## Features
- Unique world generation and new biomes
- Dozens of new structures and dungeons
- Extensive farming, food, and animal mods
- Magic and power stemming from nature
- Primitive vehicular transport
- Questing, progression, and skill trees
- Performance and quality of life improvements

## Installation

  - Download the modpack from Curse Forge https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/mushroom-craft-2
  - Play!
  - I highly recommend dedicating a decent amount of ram for a single-player world (4-10gb) as well as playing with DH settings and other quality/general settings through the given modded menus via video settings.
